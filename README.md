# Artificial-Neural-Network---Titanic-Survival-Prediction-
Most Welcome if you are here for basic concepts of ANN 






This project simply takes the input from the user and predicts whether the user could survive if he was in titanic.








At first the prediction model with 84% accuracy was made using ANN(Artificial Neural Network).






After that saved ANN model was loaded in another piece of code to make prediction.




STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED :






Step1 : Run csv_edit.py for Columns of your interest and new csv is made after this "final.csv"






Step 2 : Run titanic_using_ann.py for making prediction model using ANN and Saving it as .yaml or .jason and also saving weigths as .h5






Step3 : Run use_model.py for using saved model on user input.
